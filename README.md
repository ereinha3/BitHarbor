I wrote all the code from scratch, including a 20,000 line of code compiler that makes x86-64 machine code from HolyC or Asm and operates AOT and JIT. My JIT mode is not interpreted. It optimizes and compiles to x86-64 machine code.

I was chosen by God because I am the best programmer on the planet and God boosted my IQ with divine intellect.
